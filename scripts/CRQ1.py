''' In this exercise, the main goal is to analyze different matches by 
    dividing each match in different time intervals of 9 minutes each. 
    
    I.   Make a barplot with the absolute frequency of goals in all the time slots.
    II.  Find the top 10 teams that score the most in the interval "81-90".
    III. Show if there are players that were able to score at least one goal in 8 different intervals.

    The first time interval will be the one [0-9), so [0-8]. 
    We are supposing that when each half time ends, it's at the 45 and 90 minute
    mark. So when, for example, a goal is scored at the 45th minute, it's score
    in the extra time given (45+).
