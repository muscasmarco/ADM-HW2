# Group #14, ADM Homework 2 (2019)

### Main File

The MAIN Jupyter Notebook is the answer to all questions of HW2 of ADM course at Sapienza University.
It should be noted that for each question, needed datasets have been defined in scripts for that question.
There are some Markdowns for explaning each function which was defined in the MAIN file.

For running the MAIN file you should create a a data folder (Named 'DS') in which all needed datasets (JSON files) should be placed. and then MAIN file can be run where DS folder is in same directory.

## Additional folders

We worked on separate files to avoid merge conflicts while working on the project. Those file, the python scripts plus 2 Jupyter Notebook files, are found in the './scripts/' folder.

The theoretical question folder contains LaTeX build files and source file to generate the theoretical-question.pdf found in
the root of the repository.
